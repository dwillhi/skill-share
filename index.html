            <h2>What is Version Control</h2>        
            <p>Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.</p>
            <p>Version control helps teams solve these kinds of problems, tracking every individual change by each contributor and helping prevent concurrent work from conflicting. Changes made in one part of the software can be incompatible with those made by another developer working at the same time. This problem should be discovered and solved in an orderly manner without blocking the work of the rest of the team. Further, in all software development, any change can introduce new bugs on its own and new software can't be trusted until it's tested. So testing and development proceed together until a new version is ready.</p>

            <h2>What is Git</h2>  
            <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.</p>     
            <p>Git is the most commonly used version control system today and is quickly becoming the standard for version control. Git is a distributed version control system, meaning your local copy of code is a complete version control repository. These fully-functional local repositories make it is easy to work offline or remotely. You commit your work locally, and then sync your copy of the repository with the copy on the server. This paradigm differs from centralized version control where clients must synchronize code with a server before creating new versions of code.</p>

            <h2>What is GitHub</h2>  
            <p>GitHub is a Git repository hosting service. Think of it as the "cloud" for code. GitHub can be found at <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a>.</p>
